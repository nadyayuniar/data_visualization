# data_visualization

This was my project when I was took Data Mining course during my college period in Statistics Department, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya. My friend and I got project to make visualization data about Car Sale Advertisements in Ukraine from 1953 until 2020. The dataset used was downloaded from kaggle, you can directly visit the dataset by clicking on this link https://www.kaggle.com/antfarol/car-sale-advertisements . Hopefully this repository can help you to improve your visualization skills using Python. Thank you!
